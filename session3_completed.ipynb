The dataset we have chosen is from a paper by [Blain and Rutledge](https://elifesciences.org/articles/57977) and is available [here](https://archive.softwareheritage.org/browse/revision/b7c4a0cd761dcf249c72caf809dd81af24c4a49b/). You don't have to download the dataset yourself, our code will do that for you. For now, read through the paper to see what design choices Blain and Rutledge made to run the task. How is the task they ran similar or different to what we have been discussing so far? Hint: to answer this question you don't have to read the entire paper from beginning to end, it is sufficient to skim-read the paper to identify the relevant sections in which the authors describe how they ran their task."

        "To see whether participants are disengaging from the task, we can consider taking a look at their response times. Analysing response time data would also allow us to see if participants respond too fast, which might indicate that they are making random responses without considering the options on the screen. However, in the interest of time, we will not look at response times here. Instead, we will limit ourselves to considering the choices participants made to decide whether to include or exclude them.\n",
        "\n",
        "To this end, it makes a lot of sense to fit models to the choice data first, and to use these model fits to diagnose whether to exclude participants. Remember, the question we want to answer is whether participants have a higher learning rate in the volatile compared to the stable block. One way to interpret this question is that we expect participants *that learn about the probabilities of the options* to have a higher learning rate. Under this interpretation, the learning rates we fit to participants that do not learn about probabilities but solve the task in some other way are not meaningful, and there might thus be good reason to exclude them from our analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using the model fits to diagnose whether to exclude participants can be done by reminding ourselves of the meaning of the model parameters. For example, for the learning rate $\\alpha$, what does it imply if a learning rate is at its lower extreme (0) or higher extreme (1)? Can we still claim that participants *learned* in these extreme cases? Does this depend on the utility function we used? Similarly, for the inverse temperature $\\beta$, what does it mean if it is at its lower extreme (0) or higher extreme (approaching infinity)? Finally, what do extreme values of $\\omega$ (0 or 1) imply for the strategies participants use? Having reminded yourself of the meaning of these parameters, for which extreme values of which parameters would you consider excluding participants, and why?"

We then do this for every participant, where every time we determine which model describes this participant best.
