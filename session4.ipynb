We recommend that you look back through your notes and the questions and answers from the previous sessions (including today) to help you with this section. It can also helpful to look at the style of the Methods in related publications.\n",

        "2.   Experimental task design: Look back at the slides and notebooks from the previous weeks. These will already include descriptions of the rationale behind designing the task the way it is. Feel free to adapt them and make sure to put them down in your own words in your Methods section. Also look at Blain and Rutledge (2020) for the specific version of the task that we are analysing. Include a figure capturing the main aspects of the task.\n",

If there are several different variables within the same plot, add a legend (in the figure) to describe what they mean.\n",

        "3.   Discuss how the findings relate to the previous literature: Here, you could compare how the task design that Blain and Rutledge (2020) used is different from the original Behrens et al. (2007) design. Do you think the changes Blain and Rutledge (2020) made make the task more or less suited for answering our questions? You can also discuss how the way Blain and Rutledge (2020) fitted and analysed their data differed from what you did. Do you think their model fits and analyses are more or less suited for answering the questions we are interested in?\n",

Limitations to the data and analyses and future analyses: Describe whether any of the analyses done were not yet decisive and what analyses you could have done additionally to corroborate your findings further.

        "During the last weeks, we modelled and analysed data from a task that was heavily inspired by [Behrens et al, 2007](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn1954). The actual data we used was taken from a paper by [Blain and Rutledge, 2020](https://elifesciences.org/articles/57977), who ran a task similar to Behrens et al. in order to study the effects of the task on moment-to-moment subjective self reports of happiness. In our analysis we disregarded these happiness measures and instead went back to the question that Behrens et al. asked: are participants adapting their beliefs about reward faster in a volatile compared to a stable environment?\n",

We will do so again here now, but this time we will use the specific schedules used by Blain and Rutledge, and also base our simulations on parameters we fitted earlier. The function in the code cell below simulates data of artificial participants that complete the task Blain and Rutledge designed. It bases these simulations on a previous model fit. The first argument that we give to the function is a list of fitted parameters (that were fitted to the actual participants). The function then takes these parameters and randomly shuffles them. This way a participant's choices will be simulated with a different combination of the parameters. For example, a simulated participant might have the learning rate from participant 3 and the inverse temperature from participant 50. The function then fits all 4 models that we discussed to each simulated participant. This will allow us to verify that the correct model (which is the one we actually simulated with) is also the model that fits the data better than the other 3.\n",
